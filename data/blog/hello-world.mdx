Hello and welcome, dear readers, to this sanctum of chaos and code, a place where logic dances with madness. I intend to take you kicking and screaming through the depths of my ruminations.

<br />

You might ask, "Why put us through this?" From deep within a rabbit hole, lost and
hungry, I'd shout back, "It's for your own good".

<br />

But this isnâ€™t just a place of stories and gibberish. Among our wild adventures, I promise to sprinkle in tips, advice, and thoughts that might just save you. Be it the virtues of a clean architecture, or the dark magic needed to traverse this journey we're all on. Let this be your guide.

<br />

Yours, <br/>
Elliot
