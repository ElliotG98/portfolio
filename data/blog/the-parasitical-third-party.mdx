# The Parasitical Third Party Company.

I've recently been working at a e-commerce platform which on joining was sold. The newly acquired company decided to bring in a third-party who asserted they could build and develop and migrate to a new website in a matter of weeks and if that wasnâ€™t enough they would do it for a substantially lowered rate. Ofcourse they took it, this left me in an unusual position, having joined a company where half the work was outsourced I was left with the app.

Through this time working with this company I have found them to be what I can only describe as parasitical. The very nature of this company appears to prey on non-technical executives selling them buzz words in hopes of gaining more control within the company. At first they start of as a tool, a helpful tool but one which slowly turns into something else. Each move seems to further one goal - to manage all technical needs. Great business right... not so much, I've found them to produce sub-par work, long timelines and evasive tactics.
